# Feature and Polynomial Regression
Imagine we have a house with two features that we want to use to predict its price: `frontage` and `depth`. 

We don't actually have to use the only two features at our disposal, we can also create new features, such as the `area` which is `frontage * depth`.

## Polynomial Regression
Similar to creating new features, polynomial regression can help us fit non-linear datasets. For example a cubic function might best model our data for housing prices.

For example, with single-variable linear regresion, we can expand out our x<sub>1</sub> term by squaring it and then cubing it.

 h<sub>θ</sub>(x) = θ<sub>0</sub> + θ<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + θ<sub>2</sub>(x<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + θ<sub>3</sub>(x<sub>1</sub>)<sup>3</sup>

We can also use a square root:

h<sub>θ</sub>(x) = θ<sub>0</sub> + θ<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + θ<sub>2</sub>sqrt(x<sub>1</sub>)


We will later introduce algorithms that can help us choose which kind of polynomial regression might help us here.
