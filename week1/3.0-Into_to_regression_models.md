# 3.0 Intoduction to Regression Models
Some review. Examples of Regression Problems:
* Predict Housing prices in your area
* Predict Automotive Sales per region
* Predit credit risk, etc.

Dependent Variable: Y
Independent Variables: X=[X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ...]

Gradient Descent - iterative fashion of coming to a minimum
Normal Equations - non-iterative method for solving for a minimum

## Output Metrics
You need to go from being qualitative to quantitative: "quantitatively, this model is better."

Given x, y, yhat, yavg for N samples

R Square/Adjusted R Square (Higher = Better):
* Measures how much variability in the dependent variable can be explained by the model. Squared correlation coefficient.

Mean Squared Error (MSE)/ Root MSE (RMSE) (Lower = Better):
* Measures model fit

Mean Absolute ERror (MAE) (Lower = Better):
* Measure of Absolute error in model fit

**MSE gives larger penalization to large prediction error by squaring it, while MAE treats all errors the same**

## Generalized Linear Models (GLM)
General class of linear models that are mad up of 3 components:
1. Random
2. Systematic
3. Link Function

* Random Component:
    * Identifies dependent variable (Y) and its probability 
        * For Linear Regression, we assume that the data follows a Gaussian (Normal) Distribution
        * For classification (Logistic Reg.), we assume that the data follows a Bernoulli (Head/Tail) distribution, p = probability of event
* Systematic Component:
    * Identifies the set of explanatory variables (X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>n</sub>, ...)
* Link Function:
    * Identifies a function of the mean that is a linear function of the explanatory variables. It explains how the expected value of the response relates to the explanatory variables.
    * Maps the mean value of Y to the set of explanatory values (X<sub>1,2,n</sub>)
        * Identity Link, for linear regression (mean values)
        * Log link, when mean cannot be negative in Poisson distributions (think housing prices, huge range, non-negative)
        * Logit link, when mean is bounded in [0, 1] for logistic regression (classification)
